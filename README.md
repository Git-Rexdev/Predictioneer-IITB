# Model README

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning model that processes and analyzes dataset (`train_data.csv`). The model includes data cleaning, visualization, and predictive analysis using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, cleaning data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Model training using Scikit-Learn
- API integration (commented-out weather API call for temperature data)

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn requests tqdm
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Git-Rexdev/Predictioneer-IITB.git
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook model.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to clean data, visualize insights, and train the model.

## Data
The model uses a dataset (`train_data.csv`). Ensure this file is present in the working directory before running the notebook.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository, submit issues, and contribute improvements.
